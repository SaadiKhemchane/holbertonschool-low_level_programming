# Hash tables
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn how to implement Hash Tables with `C language`<br>
Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data<br>


# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-hash_table_create.c`|Function that creates a hash table|
|`1-djb2.c`|Function that executes the djb2 algorithm|
|`2-key_index.c`|Function that returns the index of a key|
|`3-hash_table_set.c`|Function that adds an element to the hash table|
|`4-hash_table_get.c`|Function that retrieves a value associated with a key|
|`5-hash_table_print.c`|Function that prints a hash table|
|`6-hash_table_delete.c`|Function that deletes a hash table|
