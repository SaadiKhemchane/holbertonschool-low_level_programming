# Doubly Linked Lists
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about doubly linked list in `C language`.
Doubly Linked Lists in C are complex compared to a singly linked list. A doubly linked list consists of two pointers that store the address of the next successive node and the address of the previous node. The traversal in a doubly linked list happens in both forward and backward directions

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-print_dlistint.c`|Prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list|
|`1-dlistint_len.c`|Returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list|
|`2-add_dnodeint.c`|Returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list|
|`3-add_dnodeint_end.c`|Adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list|
|`4-free_dlistint.c`|Frees a `dlistint_t`|
|`5-get_dnodeint.c`|Returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list|
|`6-sum_dlistint.c`|Returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list|
|`7-insert_dnodeint.c`|Inserts a new node at a given position|
|`8-delete_dnodeint.c`|Deletes the node at index `index` of a `dlistint_t` linked list|
