# Singly Linked List
Project done during Software Engineering studies at `Holberton School`. It aims to learn about linked lists in `C language`.<br>
A Singly linked list is a collection of data called nodes, where each node is divided into two parts to store data and address at some random addresses. The pointer next, points to the address of the next node in a list.

# Technologies
- C files are compiled using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are written according to the `C89 standard`
- Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

# Files
All of the following files are programs written in C :

|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`0-print_list.c`|Prints all the elements of a `list_t` list|
|`1-list_len.c`|Returns the number of elements in a `linked list_t` list|
|`2-add_node.c`|Adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list|
|`3-add_node_end.c`|Adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list|
|`4-free_list.c`|Frees a `list_t` list|
